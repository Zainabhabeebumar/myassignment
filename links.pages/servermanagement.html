<h1><b>SERVER MANAGEMENT </b></h1>
Server role management across multiple servers 
Management of server roles is improved by shifting from a single-server, single-role model, to one in which multiple server roles can be managed remotely by using a single management application. IT pros often automate the management of their multi-computer environments by running sequences of long-running tasks or workflows that can affect multiple managed computers or devices at the same time.
Server Manager remains the key access or launch point for server management tools. Where supported, Server Manager launches these tools in the context of the remote server that you are managing. New, modern, role-specific tools (such as File Storage Management, Remote Desktop Services, and IP Address Management) are integrated into the Server Manager console.  Windows PowerShell workflows let IT pros and developers apply the benefits of workflows to the automation capabilities of Windows PowerShell. 
A workflow is a sequence of automated steps or activities that execute tasks on or retrieve data from one or more managed nodes (computers or devices). These activities can include individual commands or scripts. Windows PowerShell workflows enable IT pros and developers alike to author sequences of multicomputer management activities — that are either long-running, repeatable, frequent, parallelizable, interruptible, stoppable, or restartable — as workflows. By design, workflows can be resumed from an intentional or accidental suspension or interruption, such as a network outage, a reboot or power loss. Workflows are also portable; they can be either exported as or imported from XAML files.  
 Server Manager also helps administrators manage groups of servers collectively from within a single, integrated console, allowing them respond to business-critical problems with greater speed and agility.
Custom session configurations (also called endpoints) allows workflows or activities within a workflow to be run by delegated or subordinate users. The security descriptors on the session configurations determine who can use them to create sessions, and thus manage nodes at different stages of a workflow. 
• More than two thousand new cmdlets that are easy to find and execute.  
• Workflows that allow users to automate long running tasks across multiple computers in a resilient way. 
• Disconnected sessions that allow you to start execution on a computer and return to it later (possibly from another computer). 
• The ability to delegate a set of credentials that will be used when commands are run in certain sessions.
