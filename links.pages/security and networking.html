Before you can understand ? rewalls and how ISA Server 2006 works, you need to look at the big picture: what we mean by network security in general – and Internet security in particular – why it’s necessary, how we can create a comprehensive security policy to protect our networks from unauthorized access, and where ISA Server ? ts into that picture. Network security is a big topic and is growing into a high pro? le (and often highly paid) Information Technology (IT) specialty area. Security-related websites are tremendously popular with savvy Internet users. The popularity of security-related certi? cations has expanded. Esoteric security measures like biometric identi? cation and authentication – formerly the province of science ? ction writers and perhaps a few ultra-secretive government agencies – have become commonplace in corporate America. Yet, with all this focus on security, many organizations still implement security measures in an almost haphazard way, with no well-thought-out plan for making all the parts ? t together. Computer security involves many aspects, from protection of the physical equipment to protection of the electronic bits and bytes that make up the information that resides on the network. In the next section, we will provide a brief overview of what we mean by “security” and how it applies to your computer network.
This chapter focuses on generic computer and Internet security concepts and how to develop a comprehensive security plan for your organization. The rest of this book will discuss how ISA Server ? ts into that security plan.
 Control of physical accessibility to the computer(s) and/or network ¦ Prevention of accidental erasure, modi? cation or compromise of data ¦ Detection and prevention of intentional internal security breaches ¦ Detection and prevention of unauthorized external intrusions (hacking)
Network security solutions are loosely divided into three categories: hardware, software and human. In this chapter, we will provide an overview of basic security concepts. Then, we will examine the four security objectives and look at each of the three categories of security solutions.
