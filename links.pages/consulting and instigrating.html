This Standard Document for the Request for Proposals (RFP) has been prepared by the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development for the procurement of Consulting Services (Firms) using short lists of consultants, and to enable Procuring Entities to select the best evaluated proposals. 
 
The Standard Request for Proposals (RFP) can be used for all selection methods of procurement of Consulting Services, either time-based or lump sum (with the exception of the procurement of Individual Consultants’ services), which are: 
 
1. Quality-Based Selection (QBS) 2. Quality and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS) 3. Selection under a Fixed Budget (FBS) 4. Least Cost-Based Selection (LCS) 5. Selection based upon Consultants’ Qualifications (CQS) 6. Single Source Selection (SSS) 
 
The Instructions to Consultants (ITC) and the General Conditions of Contract (GCC) should be used un-amended and procurement specific information inserted only through the Proposal Data Sheet (PDS), Special Conditions of Contract (SCC) and the Terms of Reference (ToR).  
 
Consultants will be required to complete and submit all of the Standard Proposal Forms for the first four selection methods shown above. They will not be required to complete all of the Standard Forms for: (i) method 5, as they will not be asked to provide a work plan or methodology for the assignment; and for (ii) method 6, the Firm will already have been identified, so the details of the Firm’s experience will not be required. The Forms that should be completed for each type of procurement method used are indicated in the PDS and care must be taken to ensure that the correct Forms are furnished.  
 
The Contract Form attached to the Request for Proposals can be used both for time-based assignments and lump sum-based assignments through editing of the Special Conditions of Contract and completion of the Schedule of Activities during Contract negotiations.  
 
Advertising for Expressions of Interest (EOI) is mandatory for all selection methods but Single Source Selection. A sample format for requesting Expressions of Interest prior to short-listing is provided in this document, however the sample format should not form part of the RFP sent to short-listed Consultants and is contained for guidance only.
